# Trying out the built-in container support for the .NET 7 SDK

A few months ago the built-in container support in the .NET 7 SDK was announced.
This feature allows us to create containerized versions of our applications just using the ``dotnet publish`` command and without the need of having a Dockerfile. 

I don't want to try this feature with a "Hello World" .NET app, I know that it works well with it, instead let's try it with a more realistic .NET line of business application and see how it performs.

Work in progress.
