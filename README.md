# Trying out the built-in container support for the .NET 7 SDK

A few months ago the built-in container support in the .NET 7 SDK was announced.
This feature allows us to create containerized versions of our applications just using the ``dotnet publish`` command and no need of using a Dockerfile at all. 

Let's try this feature with a real world line of business application, and see how it performs.

Work in progress.
